            <h3>About Priya</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Priya is a UK-verified specialist dietitian registered with the Health and
                Care Professions Council (HCPC), and a member of the British Dietetic Association (BDA) and the Indian
                Dietetic Association (IDA). She began her professional journey in 2015 after completing her Master’s in
                Clinical Nutrition and Dietetics, and has since developed extensive experience across diverse clinical
                settings.

                Her career spans outpatient and inpatient care, with roles in diabetes specialities, gastroenterology,
                paediatrics, endocrinology, and acute hospital care. This broad foundation has shaped her holistic,

                gastroenterology, offering specialist support for digestive health and related conditions.

                She has consistently delivered impactful dietary interventions that contribute to improved outcomes in
                obesity, diabetes, and gastrointestinal disorders. Her practice is rooted in patient-centred care, clear
                communication, and long-term lifestyle management.

                Priya is also the founder of Diet Lab by Priya, a YouTube platform dedicated to dietetic education,
                where she promotes public understanding of nutrition and health.

                In the UK, she collaborates with NHS trusts, supports communication with GPs for integrated care, and
                works with health insurance providers to make dietetic services more accessible. Her consultancy is GDPR
                compliant and holds Data Security and Protection Toolkit (DSPT) status with Standards Met.
